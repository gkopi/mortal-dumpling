	<!-- could have a slider w/ event photos
		could have the event content blocks just like home...
		home would also have:
		an about blurb
		a bulk order blurb
		and an emaillist signup?
		
		Should rename EventContent to EventContentBlock
		and make EventContent be the container object for EventContentBlocks
		
		should also make an AboutBlurb (belonging to HomeContent)
		an email signup form (belonging to HomeContent)
		and a BulkOrderBlurb also in HomeContent (both blurbs could use the same form?)
		Maybe a "How to Get Our Food" blurb (1. Check Events, 2. Get a bulk order, 3. Ask us to do an event)
		
		Bulk order section
		Could use foundation to make something else... accordion box, or something. Honestly,
		I don't think the content needs to be hidden. Perhaps a pdf would be best - laTex?
		
		About: I want a pic in the top right, order inserted partway through the text on small screens? Or no
		pic on small screens? Or at the bottom? Anyways, it will be plain text.
